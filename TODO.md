# Refactoring admin.js

- [ ] Wrap entire code in IIFE for encapsulation
- [ ] Organize code into sections: Constants, DOM Elements, Utility Functions, Data Management, UI Rendering, Event Handlers, Initialization
- [ ] Add missing fPassword to DOM elements list
- [ ] Ensure variables use const/let appropriately
- [ ] Move seat-grid logic into its own section within the IIFE
- [ ] Verify the refactored structure maintains functionality
